This directory contains some example input files for the ffsim and bfsim 
programs.  The corresponding .out files are the result of running ffsim
on the input file.

test_diagram - the transaction file used for the diagrams in the handout
test_sample - a longer transaction file that leads to a slightly more 
	interesting freelist
test_open - a transaction file that opens an existing file system. Note that
	this will fail if myfs is not a valid file system file.


NOTE: When you run the starter code on these transaction files, you will NOT
get the same output.
